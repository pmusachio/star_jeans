Star Jeans is a company that is entering the american men's jeans market, competing with H&M and Macys with an E-commerce business model.

The strategy is to keep the cost of operation low and scale as they acquire customers.

However, even with the entry product and the defined public, star jeans lacks experience in this fashion market and still does not know how to define things like price, type of pants and material for making each piece.

## Business Problem
- What is the best selling price for the pants?
- How many types of pants and their colors for the initial product?
- What are the raw materials needed to make the pants?

## Business Assumptions
- Pricing strategy can be defined based on the price of leading companies
- H&M and Macys are reference companys in the market

## Solution Strategy
- **What is the best selling price for the pants?**
    - Use of webscraping to extract data related to the product using competitors websites as a benchmark ['H&M'](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/men/products/jeans.html) and ['Macys'](https://www.macys.com/shop/mens-clothing/mens-jeans?id=11221&edge=hybrid)
    - Data Cleaning and Transformation of variables.


- **How many types of pants and their colors for the initial product?**
